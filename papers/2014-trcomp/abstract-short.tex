In our project we aim to build an online infrastructure for providing
translation to social media and gathering relevant training data to support
machine translation of such content. Social networks have gained tremendous
popularity but the natural language barrior remains. While machine translation
can perform satisfactorily on edited texts, it is still near to unusable on
noisy badly-written messages on social networks. We endeavour to solve this
inadequacy by crowdsourcing.
